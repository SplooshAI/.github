## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Sploosh.AI is to be inclusive to all community members with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community and the consequences of unacceptable behavior.

## 2. Technical Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this code of conduct is to increase technical citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and power abuses in society.

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

Whether you are an inquiring visitor, an existing prospect or client, or a contributor to Sploosh.AI, our commitment to you is to ensure you are able to participate in a technically challenging and rewarding environment.
